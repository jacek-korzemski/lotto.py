# Simulate lottery (EuroJackpot) until it repeats it's numbers

This is just a simple student project made to practice some Python.
It works like this: you repeat draw until you catch a numbers that already was earlier.
Then - display how many draws was repeated until that one golded winner.

## Conclusion

I've used it for some kind of analytics. I've repeated the process for the 100 times,
and I reached interesting conclusions. The probality of winning the 5 numbers is about 1:54201.
But after a 100 tests, none of them took more than 7 000 draws to repeat numbers. So, you don't
have to buy 54201 entries with different numbers to win. 7 000 is enough to have really high chance
to win.

### Additional info

EuroJackpot also randomizes dwo additional numbers from 1 to 10, so all in all you need 7 numbers
from two different mathematical sets, but the prize from only 5 first number is still huge enough :)
